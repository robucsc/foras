# Foras

**Foras** is a modern reimagining of Forth, designed for concurrency, extensibility, and high-performance computing.

Built in Swift, Foras brings Forth’s composable, stack-based philosophy into the 21st century with:

- ✳️ Object-based word definitions
- 🧵 Native multithreading and `Sendable` safety
- 🔍 Built-in introspection and documentation
- ⚙️ Planned IR generation and LLVM backend
- 🔬 Future support for SIMD, GPU, and task-based dispatch

Programs in Foras are made of composable words—just like Forth—but words are objects, allowing for richer typing, metadata, and behaviors. This makes Foras as expressive as a modern scripting language, while preserving the simplicity of Forth’s execution model.

The name "Foras" means "Forth" in Latin, honoring the lineage while moving boldly forward.
