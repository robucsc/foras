Initial working prototype of Foras

- Bootstrapped project with Swift Package Manager
- Implemented ForasVM with support for dynamic word registration
- Added stack helpers for type-safe stack access
- Defined core words: + . dup
- Words are implemented as Sendable structs
- Auto-generated word registry with build-time script
- Evaluates .fs files using a tokenizer + VM dispatcher
- Designed architecture for future LLVM/IR, GPU, fiber support

Foras is a modern, multi-threaded, object-oriented take on Forth, with an emphasis on clean structure, safety, and forward compatibility.
